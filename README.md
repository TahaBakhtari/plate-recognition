# plate-recognition
 This project is a Persian license plate recognition system using machine learning. It processes plate images, trains a model to recognize digits, and applies it to full plates. The system segments the plate image, predicts each digit, and reconstructs the complete plate number. It's designed specifically for Persian license plates.
